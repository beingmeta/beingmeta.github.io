    <h1 id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0001">Introduction</h1>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0001p0001">In the current e-book landscape,
	major players like Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and Apple have
	consolidated the traditional functions of selling, printing, and
	distribution.  Especially when associated with current platform
	lock-in (due mostly to DRM), this suppresses both competition
	and cooperation (together with their associated creativity).  We
	want to create an open environment and marketplace characterized
	by a diversity of creators, suppliers, and vendors of all sorts.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0001p0002">sBooks reinvents the experience of
	reading and the business of publishing to encourage creation,
	conversation, and engagement with interesting ideas.  Its
	success will enable further transformations in education,
	research, public policy, and our collective intelligence.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0001p0003">sBooks is an open e-publishing and
	e-reading platform.  Our target markets include:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0001p0004"><strong>readers:</strong>
	  including people who buy books as well as libraries and their
	  patrons:</li>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0001p0005"><strong>authors:</strong> people
	  who create books and other content;</li>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0001p0006"><strong>publishers:</strong>
	  people and organizations who support authorship and help to
	  create the fit of author to market;</li>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0001p0007"><strong>booksellers:</strong>
	  people and organizations who enable and encourage discovery
	  around content and meta-content;</li>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0001p0008"><strong>meta-publishers:</strong>
	  people and organizations who create overlays (free and paid)
	  on existing content (free and paid)</li>
      </ul>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0001p0009">This list is so long because we're
	creating a new publishing ecosystem with many different roles
	which need to be populated.  The good news is, that for the most
	part, the incremental change required by any individual or
	organization is relatively small.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0001p0010">Our "product" looks different for
	each of these classes of customers.  Here's a breakdown.</p>
    </section>
  <section class="sbookauto sbookautosect1">
    
    <h1 id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0002">FOR READERS</h1>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0002p0001">sBooks provide two key advantages to
	readers: reading and rights.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0002p0002">In the area of reading, sBooks
	provide a better reading experience through:</p>
    <ul>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0002p0003">improved interface: sBooks are
	  easier to navigate and browse;</li>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0002p0004">social reading: sBooks can be
	  read by groups of individuals, supporting, encouraging and
	  challenging one another;</li>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0002p0005">overlays: notes, links, and tags
	  created by individuals or organizations for existing books;
	  and</li>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0002p0006">smart search: books become
	  naturally non-linear when there is effective indexing and
	  search.</li>
      </ul>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0002p0007">In the area of rights, sBooks
	distinguishes itself in two ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0002p0008">sBooks is an open web-based
	  platform enabling anyone to publish sBook content through
	  their own sites.  Our primary delivery platform is late-model
	  web browsers, whether on tablets, desktops, phones, or
	  whatever comes next.  There is no device-lock-in.</li>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0002p0009">when we sell sBooks ourselves, we
	  do so under a license which attempts to grant the rights which
	  people have come to accept for physical books.</li>
      </ul>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0002p0010">In developing our products for
	readers, we have two goals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0002p0011">creating an outstanding user
	  experience;</li>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0002p0012">supporting books as long-term
	  personal artifacts.</li>
      </ul>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0002p0013">We get revenues from readers in at
	least four ways:</p>
    <ol>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0002p0014">when they buy an sBook (from
	  anyone), they may need to pay to use our service for sharing
	  or storing annotations;</li>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0002p0015">when they join a closed reading
	  group or purchase a paid overlay, we get a piece of that
	  transaction;</li>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0002p0016">when they buy an sBook through
	  us, we provide (1) for free but take a piece of the
	  purchase;</li>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0002p0017">we provide a subscription service
	  which allows readers to upload their own books for use with
	  sBooks.  We correlate what they upload with our own books and
	  other uploads, allowing the sBooks annotation and sharing
	  features to work with uploaded books.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>
  <section class="sbookauto sbookautosect1">
    
    <h1 id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0003">FOR AUTHORS</h1>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0003p0001">We want to encourage authors to
	create content for sBooks.  Our chief advantages for authors
	are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0003p0002">high royalty rates: they get more
	  per title, with minimal overhead;</li>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0003p0003">after-market revenue: when
	  authors publish with us, they get a slice of our profit from
	  reading groups and overlays;</li>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0003p0004">responsive payment: we use
	  digital payment technologies to deliver royalty payments
	  almost instantaneously;</li>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0003p0005">access to their audience through
	  a variety of means, including social networks and dedicated
	  overlays;</li>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0003p0006">pricing flexibility: authors can
	  control maximum, minimum, and discount prices (see
	  below);</li>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0003p0007">authoring tools: we provide tools
	  for creating, editing, and producing sBooks; we also
	  (incidentally) provide tools for generating e-books in other
	  formats (ePub and Kindle) from their publications.</li>
      </ol>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0003p0008">We may charge separately for certain
	parts of 4+6.  Otherwise, we get revenue from sales, subject to
	a pricing model.  The pricing model explicitly includes
	booksellers as a means for book discovery and marketing.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0003p0009">The pricing model has two basic parameters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0003p0010">the "sale price" what the reader pays for the book;</li>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0003p0011">the "discount price" is the
	  amount guaranteed for each sale; the author/publisher gets at
	  least 80% of this (minus payment service transaction
	  costs);</li>
      </ul>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0003p0012">The author or publisher can also set
	minimums and maximums for the sale price and receives 10% of the
	markup between the discount price and the sale price.  If the
	sale price is below the discount price, the seller pays the
	difference to the publisher (with a slice to us).</p>
    </section>
  <section class="sbookauto sbookautosect1">
    
    <h1 id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0004">FOR PUBLISHERS</h1>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0004p0001">All of the advantages for authors
	also apply to publishers.  We believe that publishers have a
	crucial role in the book ecosystem.  Part of this role is to
	help authors with creating their books, including editorial
	support, rights clearance, and custom content (graphics, images,
	video, etc).</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0004p0002">Another important role for
	publishers is managing the fit of authors and markets to enhance
	both impact and revenue.  In the digital age, an individual
	author and easily write something and distribute it globally;
	the challenge is getting it written and distributed so that it
	is read!  Some rare authors have a gift for this, but most do
	not.  That is the challenge where the publisher's role is most
	important, not just marketing, but advising and adjusting the
	content and design of a work to make a publication with greater
	impact and reach.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0004p0003">Publishing, especially in the
	English-speaking world, is still dominated by the "big six"
	publishing houses: .  These houses, which have mostly grown by
	mergers and acquisitions, contain dozens of branded imprints and
	exist alongside hosts of smaller publishers.  But in our digital
	age, the advantages of scale in publishing are reduced.  We
	expect that this will lead to the development of
	"micro-publishing" where individuals with a vision and
	associated skills will help authors manage their fit to markets
	while also coordinating support from editors, designers, legal
	experts, and other creatives.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0004p0004">"Micropublishing" is about high
	quality lean production and is close to what Guy Kawasaki has
	recently started calling artistanal publishing.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0004p0005">While we will do what we can to
	make "Big Six" titles available as sBooks, our primary market
	consists of smaller publishers or nascent "micropublishers"
	with a vision which can become a brand.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0004p0006">Our initial offering to
	micropublishers will be our platform for publishing and, on
	the flip side, our platform for supporting writing and
	editing.  We will probably offer a free version of the
	platform to micropublishers with a premium tier providing more
	functionality and support.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0004p0007">In the medium term, we will create
	a services marketplace for micropublishers, providing access
	to editors, artists, coaches, and even legal experts.  There
	are various companies which already provide this kind of
	marketplace and we might partner with one (or several) of
	these companies.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0004p0008">In the medium to longer term, we
	hope to support micropublishers financing needs by providing a
	platform for "crowdfunding" particular titles.  This could
	provide financing for book creation and preparation while also
	providing a built-in team of marketers and evangelists when a
	book is released.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0004p0009">A further advantage of sBooks to publishers (and authors)
      lies in the potential to check for <em>proof of purchase</em> on
      priced e-books before allowing some (or any) sBooks features to
      be used with a book.  For example, every book sale could have a
      crypotgraphically validated code associating a particular user
      (identified by, for example, an email address) with a particular
      title from a particular publisher.  Our sBooks service could
      then provide only limited functionality for a particular title
      without the presence of a valid proof of purchase.</p>
    
    </section>
  <section class="sbookauto sbookautosect1">
    
    <h1 id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0005">FOR BOOKSELLERS</h1>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0005p0001">In the current e-book marketplace,
	the technology providers sell books directly to readers,
	leaving booksellers with little or no role.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0005p0002">In the traditional bound book
	marketplace, nearly all sales went through booksellers, who
	were also the principal means by which readers discovered new
	books.  Booksellers also provided "tactical marketing" for
	their physical neighborhoods and simplified marketing for
	publishers: their intermediate customers were bookstores
	rather than readers.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0005p0003">Both of these roles can still be
	important in the e-book marketplace while becoming mostly
	independent of physical location. Currently, readers,
	publishers, and technology providers are still trying to sort
	out e-book discovery and creating incentives for online
	booksellers --- who will target particular audiences --- is
	one promising channel.  In addition, booksellers can create
	community around the books they sell, a key to the kind of
	engagement which will drive after-market revenue.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0005p0004">For these reasons, booksellers are
	directly included in the sBooks model and pricing system.
	Booksellers make money not through direct sales, but through
	referrals which operate like an associates program.  The
	bookseller gets 80% of the difference between the sale price
	and the discount price.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0005p0005">Those referrals allow the creation
	of various kinds of bundles, including bundles integrating
	overlays of various sorts.  Some overlays may only be
	available through particular booksellers, creating
	opportunities for sellers to create distinguished products and
	to leverage their expertise at understanding and shaping the
	communities they serve.</p>
    </section>
  <section class="sbookauto sbookautosect1">
    
    <h1 id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0006">FOR META-PUBLISHERS</h1>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0006p0001">These are the most hypothetical of
	our customers, consising of individuals and organizations who
	create overlays on sBooks.  These overlays can provide
	explanation, critique, or context.  Using overlay tags, they
	can make books more searchable and browsable, especially for
	particular audiences or viewpoints.  Using overlay links, they
	can use images, sound, or even applications to enrich a book's
	core content.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0006p0002">There are three existing kinds of
	content creators who we expect will naturally become
	meta-publishers: educators, bloggers, booksellers, and the
	publishers themselves.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0006p0003">EDUCATORS already create content
	around existing books and provide that content, usually
	delivered personally, to the individuals and communities they
	teach.  By creating and distributing this content as overlays
	to sBooks, this will improve the reach of great educators
	while supporting their work.  It will also allow on-site
	teachers to leverage great resources while personalizing the
	learning experience for students skills and interests.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0006p0004">BLOGGERS already create new
	content and discover existing content, mostly from the ocean
	of the World Wide Web.  Bloggers provide curation, opinion,
	explanation, and argument, all of which are just as important
	in the context of a complex text as for the web.  They are
	also technologically savvy and generally have good market
	instincts.  Meta-publishing will provide another channel for
	engagement and revenue.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0006p0005">BOOKSELLERS, as reimagined above,
	create value through discover and aggregation, including the
	aggregation of content with metapublished overlays.  These
	overlays can provide the usual context or critique and can
	also provide links between bundled books.  Because it will be
	possible to discount or limit overlays to versions of a book
	purchased from a particular seller, this creates an incentive
	for sellers to create valuable overlays.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0006p0006">PUBLISHERS who provide core
	content may also metapublish, either for their own content or
	other free or third-party content.  Metapublishing will allow
	publishers to increase the revenue from book sales by
	unbundling (and charging additionally for) enriched content
	and context.  Production costs for overlays should be
	significantly lower than for core content, allowing the
	creation of premium content with particularly high margins.</p>
    </section>
  <section class="sbookauto sbookautosect1">
    
    <h1 id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0007">Core Services</h1>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0007p0001">sBooks is based around three core services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0007p0002">an <strong>annotation service</strong> allowing readers to
      create, share, and apply <em>glosses</em> (notes, tags, links,
      and additional rich content) to e-books;</li>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0007p0003">an <strong>overlay marketplace</strong> supporting the
      aggregation and <em>metapublishing</em> of collections of
      glosses from a particular source (for example, an expert) or
      community (for example, a class or other association);</li>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0007p0004">a <strong>point of sale</strong> for e-books designed to work
      with the annotation service and overlay marketplace;</li>
      <li id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0007p0005">a <strong>publishing environment</strong> to help in the
      production of e-books for availability through the point of sale
      and other channels.</li>
      </ul>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0007p0006">The current sBooks Terms of Service, drafted with Mintz-Levin,
  mostly covers the use and operation of the annotation service.  It
  may need to be extended to include the overlay marketplace and
  certainly to include ebooks which are sold.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0007p0007">I am assuming that we need to have some kind of legal language
  --- contract, license, etc --- around anywhere that money changes
  hands, particularly in the overlay marketplace and at the point of
  sale.  I'd like to use the various online adaptive payment schemes
  to have transactions immediately credit to authors, publishers, and
  metapublishers, hoping that this will simplify the legal aspects.
  But I may be naive.</p>
    
    <p id="SBOOKSPLAN_h0007p0008">I'm not shy about wanting to have legal language which gives
  readers more rights than they currently get for e-books.</p>
