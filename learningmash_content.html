<p>learningmash is a new <strong>social venture</strong> to gather a
global teaching and learning community around an online commons for
high-value learning content and services.  Our <strong>social
goals</strong> are encouraging online learning worldwide, simplifying
the creation of new learning content and the reuse of existing
content, linking teachers and learners across the planet's economic
and social divides, and diversifying learning choices across the
natural variety of learning styles.  Our <strong>commercial
goals</strong> are to make online learning into an attractive and
open-ended social experience while creating a vibrant global
marketplace for high-value learning content and services.</p>

<p>The learningmash site will provide an open online destination for rich
social learning experiences where users learn with and from one
another.  At learningmash, anyone can come to take a course, create a
course, teach a course, or offer content or services for integration
in courses taught or created by others. learningmash will bring
together free content from around the web while also hosting
commercial content and seamlessly handling payment for its reuse or
aggregation.  Users of learningmash will experience membership in an
extended online community (built on existing communities like Facebook
or MySpace) centered around teaching, learning, and discovery.</p>

<p><strong>One scenario:</strong> A graduate student in Wisconsin
leads an introductory calculus course in Kenya authored by a professor
at Berkeley drawing on content from MIT's OpenCourseWare.  Students
across Kenya access the course through a variety of channels,
including inexpensive laptops, ruggedized e-books, and even cell
phones.  As students proceed through the course and the exercises,
they are aware of each others progress and questions, forging
connections for future courses and spreading into relationships and
collaborations in the physical world.</p>
