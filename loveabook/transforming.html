  <div class="subtitle">precious volumes for a digital future</div>
</div>

<p>For many precious books, electronic files are not available,
meaning that the content of the book has to be recovered by optical
scanning and OCR.  Many organizations have been scanning books over
the past decade, including
the <a href="http://www.archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>
and <a href="http://books.google.com/books">Google</a>.
Unfortunately, just scanning a book doesn't translate its enchantment
to the digital world.  In addition to inevitable OCR errors, scanned
books are filled with artifacts from the printed page which make them
difficult for print-disabled readers to easily access.</p>
   
<p>In addition, nearly any bound paper book was carefully (often
lovingly) designed to fit its content to its particular form.  This
might range from the flow of text across pages, the selection and
placement of pictures or tables, the sizing and style of typefaces,
and the inclusion of notes or asides alongside the flow of the text.
Sadly, little or none of this design makes it into the electronic
version.  Practically, books need to be redesigned as e-books, taking
into account their structure and navigation, as well as the need to
support pages whose dimensions or type sizes may be changed by the
reader.</p>

<p>Finally, modern e-books provide many ways to enrich content with
links, explanation, rich media, or social features.  There is an
opportunity to enhance books' enchantment and accessibility in their
new medium.</p>

<p>Practically, the transformation of bound books into high quality
e-books inolves five stages of work:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scanning and OCR (largely done by other projects)</li>
<li>Bibliographical registration (partially done, to determine context
and copyright)</li>
<li>Proofing, correction, and structural tagging, correcting the
inevitable errors introduced by computers and identifying
relationships (footnotes, asides, etc) encoded in the original
design.</li>
<li>Redesign of the book for electronic reading, including the
introduction of structure, styling of sections, and layout constraints</li>
<li>Enrichment of the book by the tasteful and optional addition of
images, videos, sounds, explanatory links, and rich indexes.</li>
</ol>
