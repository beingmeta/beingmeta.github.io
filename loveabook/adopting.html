<p>Some of the books we rescue will be public domain texts which have
passed out of copyright.  But others are "orphan works": works which
are in copyright but out of print and generally unavailable.  With
electronic books, there is no good reason for a book to be out of
print.  We want these books to find the readers who will love them!</p>

<p>Often the electronic rights to these books are still held by or
have reverted to the original authors.  We want to find a way to
engage those authors or their descendants in our project to make their
books available for future generations.  Sales of these books at
modest prices will help support the ongoing operations of the project
as well as providing a reasonable royalty for the authors (and much
higher than they would be likely to get from a traditional
publisher).</p>

<p>For either public domain texts or orphan works, adopting them for
transformation will involve three stages:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Picking "orphans to love," identifying in-demand out-of-print
  books.  We will do this based on direct suggestions from our board
  and partners, through a web-based public voting system, and through
  a system
  for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_funding">crowd-funding</a>
  where individuals can pay to support the identification, adoption,
  and conversion of the books they love.</li>
  <li>Finding copyright holders, mostly by volunteer efforts of web
researchers, librarians, attorneys, and para-legals.</li>
  <li>Encouraging and supporting these copyright holders in making
their work available in electronic form.</li>
</ol>
<p>These efforts will take advantage of a clause in
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Act_of_1976">Copyright
Act of 1976</a> by which copyrights sold after 1978 can revert to the
authors 35 years later.  This means that, starting in 2013, many
authors will be able to make their work accessible to future
generations on their own terms.</p>
