<p>Books and their ideas are the seeds for reflection, conversation,
and imagination.  We will take our work of adoption and transformation
as an opportunity to connect people with and around ideas, crossing
barriers including age, race, and class.  Concretely, we'll do this
by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hiring young people, especially at-risk youth, to help with the
    work of adopting and transforming books, simultaneously giving
    them <strong>valuable technical skills and judgement</strong> for
    their futures while engaging them with their <strong>rich
    legacy</strong> of words and ideas.</li>
<li>Recruiting our senior citizens, who grew up in bibliocentric
    cultures, to engage with the new technology, working in concert
    with young people and connecting with a global community.</li>
<li>Enlisting knowledge-worker mentors and advisors --- editors,
     writers, designers, librarians, attorneys, technologists --- to
     guide and inform the work of paid students and volunteers.</li>
<li>Creating online conversations inside of e-books, both web-wide and
    associated with schools, libraries, and community centers.</li>
</ol>
