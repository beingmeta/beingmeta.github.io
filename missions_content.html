<p><strong>practical common sense</strong> addresses the challenge of
<em>artificial stupidity</em> by developing platforms and resources
which enable existing and emerging software applications to appreciate

<p><strong>reinventing reading</strong> recreates the <em>software of
books</em> by developing interfaces which preserve the natural
affordances of printed books while combining them with knowledge
bases, web portals, and wikis, connecting the work and the reader to

individuals.</p>

<p><strong>e-Communion</strong> connects individuals and communities
across space, time, language, and purpose, using "meaningful
technologies" of semantic description and social networking to gather
individuals together around common knowledge and purposes while
amplifying individual insight and understanding.</p>
