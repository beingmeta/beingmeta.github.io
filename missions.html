<p><strong>practical common sense</strong> addresses the challenge of
<em>artificial stupidity</em> by developing platforms and resources
which enable existing and emerging software applications to appreciate

as semantically rich, socially embedded artifacts which combine
knowledge bases, web portals, wikis, and traditional texts, connecting
readers to networks of knowledge, resources, and individuals.</p>

<p><strong>e-Communion</strong> connects individuals and communities
across space, time, language, and purpose, using "meaningful
technologies" of semantic description and social networking to gather
individuals together around common knowledge and purposes while
amplifying individual insight and understanding.</p>
