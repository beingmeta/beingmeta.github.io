  <div class="subtitle">a little knowledge can be a wonderful thing</div>
</pagehead>
<div class="cutout"><span class="inhead">Knodules</span> <strong>don't
describe the world directly</strong> but articulate linguistic
distinctions, generalities, and connections for a <strong>limited
domain</strong> across an <strong>engaged community</strong>.
<span class="inhead">Knodules</span> characterize "<strong>what a
community can agree on</strong>" including articulating differences
which they don't agree on.</div>

<p><dterm dterm="knodule">knodules:vocabulary</dterm> are
(relatively) small knowledge bases used by groups or individuals to
organize particular pools of content or other information.  Knodules
help people share knowledge and organize activity while making it
easier to navigate and search large and complex documents or
collections.</p>

<p><span class="inhead">Key concepts</span> for understanding 
how knodules distinguish and connect meanings:
<ul>

<li><span class="inhead">dterms</span> are 'disambiguated terms' which
have exactly one meaning in the domain of the knodule.  These may be
words in a natural language (like 'bank' or 'platypus') which are
unambiguous in the given domain.  Alternatively, they can also be
<strong>compound dterms</strong> which disambiguate a potentially
ambiguous term (like <dterm>bank:institution</dterm> or <dterm>Paris,
Texas</dterm>);</li> <li><span class="inhead">synonyms</span> are
natural language terms which are sometimes used, in the context of the
domain, to refer to a dterm (or the concept it identifies);</li>

<li><span class="inhead">genls</span> are dterms which are broader in
application than a particular dterm; for example,
<dterm>animal</dterm> could typically be a <sym>genl</sym> of
<dterm>dog</dterm>.  The <sym>genl</sym> relation is also domain
specific; in some domains, <dterm>pet</dterm> might be a a
<sym>genl</sym> of <dterm>dog</dterm>, but in another domain it might
not.  The inverse or <strong>mirror</strong> of <sym>genls</sym> is
<sym>specls</sym>: if x is a <sym>genl</sym> of y, then y is a
<sym>specl</sym> of x.</li>

<li><span class="inhead">roles</span> are dterms which imply a context
and can be used to describe the relationship of another term to the
context.  For example, <dterm>mother</dterm> is a role which is
defined with respect to some children (more on <a
href="semantics.fdxml">knodule semantics</a>)</li>

<li><span class="inhead">drules</span> are cues to help disambiguate
natural language to dterms and generally consist of a synonym and a
set of other dterms (called contexts).  For example, a drule for
<dterm>fish:animal</dterm> (distinguished from
<dterm>fish:food</dterm>), might have the synonym of 'fish' and a
context of the dterm <dterm>swimming</dterm>.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p><span class="inhead">That's it.</span>  beingmeta developed
knodules as a lightweight representation scheme which
is <strong>simple</strong>, rooted in <strong>natural</strong>
language, and computationally <strong>useful</strong> for search and
browsing.  beingmeta is developing tools to help users
semi-automatically create knodules and for linking knodules to one
another to allow search and browsing over larger collections.</p>

<p><span class="inhead">Open-source tools</span> are being actively
developed by beingmeta to allow the use of knodules from a range of
programming languages, including Javascript, Python, Perl, PHP, and
Java.  Knodules are also used by
beingmeta's <a href="http://www.webechoes.net/">WebEchoes</a> social
browsing site and the new <a href="http://www.sbooks.net">sBooks
platform</a>.  We are actively developing tools and services to help
individuals and communities create high-quality effective knodules for
their content or problem domains.</p>

<p><span class="inhead">Microformats</span> for describing knodules
make it easy to author or embed knodules in various contexts.  The three
core microformats are for plaintext, embedded HTML, and XML.</p>

<p>The <span class="inhead">plaintext</span> microformat is a simple
text format for describing knodules.  Described in
detail <a href="plaintext.fdxml">here</a>, the plaintext microformat
looks like this:
<div class="example">
Al Gore|Albert Gore Jr.|Goracle|^Nobel laureate|^vice-president(Bill Clinton)|.spouse=Tipper Gore|&global warming|?Gore&amp;Bill Clinton
</div>
which introduces the dterm <span class="dterm">Al Gore</span> with
synonyms 'Albert Gore Jr.' and 'Goracle', a <sym>genl</sym> of <span
class="dterm">Nobel laureate</span>, a <sym>genl</sym> of <dterm>US
vice-president</dterm> with respect to <dterm>Bill Clinton</dterm>,
and a drule which says that the word 'Gore' probably refers to the
dterm <dterm>Al Gore</dterm> in the context of the dterm <dterm>Bill
Clinton</dterm>.
</p>
<p>The <span class="inhead">html</span> microformat defines attributes
which can embed knodule information as attributes in HTML content.
This microformat is detailed <a
href="html.fdxml">here</a> and looks like:
<pre>
&lt;p dterm="Pallas Athena" synonyms="Athena"
   genls="greek goddess" drules="Athena&Zeus" roles="mother.Ulysses"&gt;
Athena was the greek goddess known for wisdom and as the mother of Ulysses.
&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
If you're being strict, you can use attributes defined in
the <tt class="uri"> http://knodules.net/</tt> namespace, but most
knodule tools work even if you use raw attributes (though they
might not validate against your chosen DTDs).
</p>
<p>Of course, we have to have an <span class="inhead">xml</span>
microformat, which is described in
detail <a href="xml.fdxml">here</a>.  The XML microformat
looks like this:
<pre>
&lt;dterm dterm="Ken's dog Rufus" domain="example.knodules.net"&gt;
  &lt;synonym&gt;Rufus&lt;/synonym&gt;
  &lt;synonym&gt;RUFUS!&lt;/synonym&gt;
  &lt;genl&gt;dog:animal&lt;/genl&gt;
  &lt;genl&gt;deceased&lt;/genl&gt;
  &lt;genl&gt;friend&lt;/genl&gt;
  &lt;role role="guardian"&gt;Ken Haase&lt;/role&gt;
  &lt;gloss lang="en"&gt;Rufus was among my best friend for many years across
    many nations and organizations.  He is missed.
  &lt;/gloss&gt;
&lt;/dterm&gt;
</pre>
which should be relatively self explanatory.  Note that this explicitly
indicates the 'domain' (which is a unique ID) for the knodule.  The XML
format also provides for the specification of information in attributes
as well as embedded elements.  The designated namespace for the XML
microformat is also <tt class="uri">http://knodules.net/</tt> and
we will eventually have a formal <a href="xml.dtd" class="deadlink">DTD</a>
and <a href="xmlschema.xml" class="deadlink">schema</a>.
