<p class="L1">being<span class="bmm">m</span><span
class='bme'>e</span><span class='bmt'>t</span><span
class='bma'>a</span> creates infrastructure, services, and
applications for <strong>meaningful computing</strong>, a new
computing paradigm based on the discrimination and representation of
human meanings and purposes.</p>

<p>Applications and services powered by beingmeta's technology can
interpret, grasp, and use human meaning to be less awkward for users
and more autonomous when appropriate.  Our vision is of a
computational web which links people and processes across space, time,
language, and culture, recognizing the connections which are important
and dismissing the differences which are superficial.  Together with
our clients and partners, we are building and supporting applications
which increase productivity, reduce mistakes, and enable effective
collaboration.</p>

<p class="L1">Spun off from the <a
href="http://www.media.mit.edu/">MIT Media Laboratory</a> in 2001,
being<span class="bmm">m</span><span class='bme'>e</span><span
class='bmt'>t</span><span class='bma'>a</span> is about trying to
solve the genuninely hard problems of content and knowledge
description while delivering solutions which work today.  We believe
that this is the only way to deliver long-lived solutions, retain
customers, and create a sustainable business.</p>

<p class="L1">The company has developed an enterprise-class
"meaningful computing" platform which supports large semantic
knowledge bases and practical natural language processing, together
with a rapid prototyping environment for web-based semantic
applications and services.  The platform is both naturally distributed
and deeply interlingual, making it a unique choice for organizations
with global reach and scope.</p>

<p class="L1">The company's technology has been deployed with major
and minor companies around the globe, focused to date on media and
information companies.  Our platform is a hybrid of protected and
open-source technology developed over fifteen years of R&amp;D on
meaning-based infrastructure and applications.</p>

<p class="L1">We are currently open to new clients who have the vision
to invest in solutions which will work now and in the future. [<a
href="mailto:sales@beingmeta.com">email</a>] We are also looking for
active outside investors who appreciate hard problems and are
comfortable with our <a href="credo.fdxml">credo</a>.  [<a
